                        Man's Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as an Auschwitz concentration camp inmate during World War II, and describing his psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a purpose in life to feel positively about, and then immersively imagining that outcome.
                        According to Frankl, the way a prisoner imagined the future affected his longevity. The book intends to answer the question "How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?" Part One constitutes Frankl's analysis of his experiences in the concentration camps, while Part Two introduces his ideas of meaning and his theory called logotherapy.

                    Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.
                    In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.

                    What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.
                    We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by lifeâ€”daily and hourly.
                    Our question must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct.
                    Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

                        Thinking, Fast and Slow is a best-selling 2011 book by Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics winner Daniel Kahneman which summarizes research that he conducted over decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky.
                        It covers all three phases of his career: his early days working on cognitive biases, his work on prospect theory, and his later work on happiness.

                        The book's central thesis is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.
                        The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion.
                        From framing choices to people's tendency to substitute an easy-to-answer question for one that is harder, the book highlights several decades of academic research to suggest that people place too much confidence in human judgement.

                    <h4>Two systems</h4>
                    In the book's first section, Kahneman describes two different ways the brain forms thoughts:


                    <ul>
                        <li>System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, subconscious</li>
                        <li>System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious</li>
                    </ul>

                    Kahneman covers a number of experiments which purport to highlight the differences between these two thought systems and how they arrive at different results even given the same inputs. Terms and concepts include coherence, attention, laziness, association, jumping to conclusions, and how one forms judgments.

                    The System 1 vs. System 2 debate dives into the reasoning or lack thereof for human decision making, with big implications for market research.
